Here lies a random collection of Java code samples I don't have anywhere else to
put publicly. Some of these are actually functional and were meant to be used in
a project at some point. Others were created purely as experiments and learning.
All have been placed here for public reference, and I've done my best to clean
them up and make sure they actually somewhat work. Hopefully you find these
useful--or at least somewhat amusing.
